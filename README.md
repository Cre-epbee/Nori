## Repository Information

Main code (bot structure & logic) is in a private repository that is synced with the host server. The public Nori repository (this one) has some of the functions and the database.

## Library

The bot uses Hikari, a static-typed microframework for Discord. Hikari is a lightweight and high-performance framework for discord bots. Nori also uses Lightbulb and Miru, which are plugins for Hikari.

## Issues

Please contact me on Discord `RawFish69` or join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/tU7eaKAWb2) for any issues or questions.
